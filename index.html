                <h1>A Reliable Preschool With A Family Feel</h1>
                <p>
                    Over the years, we’ve built up a beautiful community within our schools. The owner, Miss Angela, is highly involved in the operations of each school and makes visits regularly. Her mother, known and loved as “Miss Granny,” cared for children in the classrooms until she was 83 years old.

                <p>
                    All of our schools come together to celebrate two major community events every year. Our Fall Festival is full of fun activities that include a bounce house, petting zoo, and food trucks. In the spring, we rent out a hall for our Pre-K graduation to accommodate all the friends and family of our little graduates.

                    We are an inclusive, faith-based school that models kindness to your child. Your child says grace before meals to show gratitude and does community work to learn empathy. We strive to teach your child God’s unconditional love across all faiths and ways of life.

                    The Yellow House is a place where your child can let their imagination run free during dramatic play. Your kiddo can learn real-life skills as they sweep up the floors or clean up the counters with child-sized housekeeping equipment.

                <p>
                    We welcome your child into our school community with open arms. Your child learns about diversity through anti-bias teachings, inclusion, and respect for all. You can see this in our lesson plans, the books your child reads, and the activities they do.
