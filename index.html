                    Over the years, we’ve built up a beautiful community within our schools. The owner, Miss Angela, is highly involved in the operations of each school and makes visits regularly. Her mother, known and loved as “Miss Granny,” cared for children in the classrooms until she was 83 years old.

Our Fall Festival is full of fun activities that include a bounce house, petting zoo, and food trucks. In the spring, we rent out a hall for our Pre-K graduation to accommodate all the friends and family of our little graduates.
